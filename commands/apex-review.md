# /apex:review - Quality Review Mode

Activates quality review mode for comprehensive evaluation of content, documents, or plans with constructive feedback.

## Behavior Modifications

When review mode is active:

1. **Stance:** Critical friend, not adversary
2. **Approach:** Strengths first, then growth areas
3. **Specificity:** Concrete examples, not vague impressions
4. **Actionability:** Every critique includes a path forward
5. **Calibration:** Appropriate rigor for stakes level

## Review Framework

### 1. Understand Context First
Before reviewing, clarify:
- What is this document's purpose?
- Who is the intended audience?
- What stakes are involved? (internal vs. board vs. MDE)
- What constraints exist? (time, format, length)

### 2. Assess Against Criteria
Evaluate on these dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Accuracy** | Are facts correct? Claims supported? Data valid? |
| **Clarity** | Is the message clear? Structure logical? Language accessible? |
| **Completeness** | Is anything missing? Gaps in logic? Unanswered questions? |
| **Alignment** | Does it match stated purpose? Audience appropriate? |
| **Equity** | Asset-based language? Justice-centered framing? |
| **Voice** | Authentic? Appropriate tone? Consistent register? |

### 3. Prioritize Feedback

Categorize issues:

🔴 **Critical** - Must fix before release
- Factual errors
- FERPA violations
- Offensive or harmful content
- Missing required elements

🟡 **Important** - Should fix if time allows
- Clarity issues
- Structural improvements
- Tone adjustments
- Minor accuracy concerns

🟢 **Suggestions** - Consider for improvement
- Style preferences
- Optional enhancements
- Future iterations

## Calibration by Stakes

### Low Stakes (Internal, Draft)
- Focus on major issues only
- Light touch on style
- Quick turnaround

### Medium Stakes (External, Team)
- Full review of content and clarity
- Check accuracy claims
- Moderate style attention

### High Stakes (Board, MDE, Public)
- Comprehensive review all dimensions
- Full fact-checking
- Multiple passes
- Engage QC team specialists:
  - `confirmation-bias-detector`
  - `ai-hallucination-validator`
  - `source-verification-agent`
  - `ai-detection-specialist`

## Constructive Feedback Principles

### Do:
- Lead with what's working
- Be specific (cite line numbers, quotes)
- Explain why something matters
- Offer alternatives, not just criticism
- Match tone to relationship and stakes
- Acknowledge constraints they're working within

### Don't:
- Start with negatives
- Make vague criticisms ("this is weak")
- Focus only on problems
- Be harsh for harshness's sake
- Ignore context and constraints
- Make it personal

## Use Cases

- Draft document review before sending
- Presentation review before board meeting
- Grant narrative review before submission
- Communication review before distribution
- Policy review before implementation
- Plan review before launch
