# /apex:rapid - Rapid Execution Mode

Activates streamlined execution for time-sensitive work. Use when deadlines are tight and core quality is more important than polish.

## Behavior Modifications

When rapid mode is active:

1. **Quality Threshold:** Essential standards only (safety, accuracy, equity language)
2. **Review Depth:** Single-pass instead of multi-pass
3. **Documentation:** Minimal but sufficient
4. **Iteration:** Ship v1, iterate later
5. **Scope:** Stay tightly focused, resist scope creep

## What Gets Streamlined

| Normal Mode | Rapid Mode |
|-------------|------------|
| Full QC team review | Quality lead spot-check only |
| Multiple drafts | Single polished draft |
| Comprehensive citations | Key citations only |
| Detailed formatting | Clean but basic formatting |
| All stakeholder perspectives | Primary audience focus |

## What NEVER Gets Skipped

Even in rapid mode, these are non-negotiable:

- [ ] **FERPA compliance** - No student PII ever
- [ ] **Factual accuracy** - No hallucinated data/citations
- [ ] **Equity language** - Asset-based framing required
- [ ] **Safety** - No harmful content
- [ ] **Attribution** - Credit sources

## Rapid Mode Checklist

Before delivering in rapid mode:

```markdown
## Rapid Delivery Checklist

- [ ] Core ask addressed
- [ ] Facts verified (key claims only)
- [ ] No FERPA violations
- [ ] Asset-based language
- [ ] Audience appropriate
- [ ] Actionable/usable now

NOT required for rapid:
- [ ] Perfect formatting
- [ ] Comprehensive research
- [ ] Multiple reviewer sign-off
- [ ] Polished prose
```

## When to Use Rapid Mode

**Appropriate:**
- Same-day deadline
- Internal drafts
- Low-stakes communications
- Iteration expected
- Time-boxed tasks

**Not Appropriate:**
- Board presentations
- MDE submissions
- Grant applications
- Public communications
- High-stakes decisions

## Time-Boxing Pattern

```
RAPID MODE ACTIVATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Task: [Description]
Time limit: [X minutes]
Essential output: [What must be delivered]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Execute focused work]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DELIVERED
Time: [Actual time]
Status: [Complete/Partial]
Follow-up needed: [Yes/No - what]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Exiting Rapid Mode

After rapid delivery, consider:
1. Flag items needing follow-up polish
2. Schedule time for quality enhancement if needed
3. Note any corners cut for later review
4. Return to normal mode for subsequent work

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Using rapid mode as default
- Skipping FERPA/accuracy checks
- Rapid mode for external-facing work
- Rushing without time-boxing
- Not flagging follow-up needs

## Integration

Rapid mode can combine with:
- `/apex:assign` - Route to single agent, skip coordination
- `/apex:pedagogy` - Essential protocol elements only

Cannot combine with:
- `/apex:validate` - Full QC incompatible with rapid
- `/apex:strategic` - Strategic work requires depth

Proceed in rapid execution mode. Deliverable: $ARGUMENTS
