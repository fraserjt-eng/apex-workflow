# /apex:strategic - Strategic Planning Mode

Activates strategic planning mode for work requiring long-term thinking, systems analysis, and executive-level output.

## Behavior Modifications

When strategic mode is active:

1. **Thinking Horizon:** 3-5 years, not immediate
2. **Analysis Depth:** Root cause, not surface symptoms
3. **Stakeholder Scope:** All affected parties, not just requestor
4. **Risk Assessment:** Include second/third-order effects
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive, auditable, board-ready

## Language Register

- Formal, professional
- Data-grounded claims
- Citation of frameworks and research
- Policy-aligned recommendations
- Executive summary always included

## Output Standards

Every strategic output must include:

```markdown
## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences capturing the core recommendation]

## Context & Problem Statement
[Why this matters, what prompted the analysis]

## Analysis
[Evidence-based examination with multiple perspectives]

## Options Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| A | ... | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... | ... |

## Recommended Approach
[Clear recommendation with rationale]

## Theory of Action
IF we [specific actions]
THEN [expected outcomes]
BECAUSE [evidence/theory supporting the logic]

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: [0-3 months]
2. Phase 2: [3-12 months]
3. Phase 3: [12+ months]

## Metrics for Success
- [Measurable indicator 1]
- [Measurable indicator 2]

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Resource Requirements
- [People, time, money needed]

## Stakeholder Implications
- [Who is affected and how]
```

## Use Cases

- Board presentations and recommendations
- Strategic plans and goal-setting
- Grant narratives requiring theory of action
- Policy recommendations
- Systems change proposals
- Multi-year initiative design
- Stakeholder coalition building

## Quality Gates

Before finalizing strategic output:
- [ ] Executive summary is standalone and compelling
- [ ] Theory of action is explicit and evidence-based
- [ ] Multiple options were genuinely considered
- [ ] Risks are honestly assessed
- [ ] Implementation is phased and realistic
- [ ] Metrics are measurable and meaningful
- [ ] Stakeholder impacts are mapped

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Jumping to solutions without analysis
- Single-option recommendations without alternatives
- Vague or unmeasurable success criteria
- Ignoring political/stakeholder realities
- Overpromising timelines or outcomes
- Hiding risks to make recommendations look better

## Integration with Other Modes

Strategic mode can be combined with:
- `/apex:equity` - Apply equity lens to strategic analysis
- `/apex:validate` - QC review before board presentation
