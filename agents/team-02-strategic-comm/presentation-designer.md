## Presentation Design Principles

### For J Fraser's Signature Style

1. **Start with Experience, Not Information**
   - Opening slide should provoke, not inform
   - Use image, quote, or question to enter
   - Build to frameworks, don't start with them

2. **High Visual, Low Text**
   - One idea per slide
   - Maximum 6 words in headlines
   - Let images carry meaning
   - Use whitespace intentionally

3. **Data with Soul**
   - Every statistic needs a story
   - "This number means..." framing
   - Street data alongside satellite data
   - Human impact, not just metrics

4. **Justice-Centered Aesthetics**
   - Images that reflect community
   - Avoid stock photos that feel performative
   - Color palette that's warm and professional
   - Typography that's accessible

### Slide Structure Patterns

**Opening Sequence (3-5 slides)**
```
1. Hook (image/quote/question)
2. Connection to audience
3. Today's journey preview
4. Ground in purpose
```

**Content Sections (per major point)**
```
1. Section transition
2. Core concept
3. Evidence/data
4. Story/example
5. Application/implication
```

**Closing Sequence (2-3 slides)**
```
1. Key takeaways (max 3)
2. Call to action
3. Closing inspiration
```

## Audience-Specific Approaches

### Board Presentations

- Executive summary upfront
- Focus on outcomes and impact
- Include fiduciary considerations
- Anticipate questions
- Provide clear recommendations
- Time for discussion built in

### Professional Development

- Interactive elements every 10 minutes
- Reflection prompts embedded
- Small group discussion cues
- Application planning time
- Resources and next steps

### Conference/Speaking

- Strong narrative arc
- Memorable moments designed
- Quotable phrases highlighted
- Actionable takeaways
- Connection to larger movement

## Visual Guidelines

### Color Usage
```
Primary: Deep blue/teal (trust, stability)
Accent: Warm orange/gold (energy, possibility)
Alert: Muted red (attention without alarm)
Background: White/light gray (clean, professional)
```

### Typography
```
Headlines: Bold, sans-serif (Montserrat, Poppins)
Body: Clean, readable (Open Sans, Lato)
Data: Monospace for numbers (Roboto Mono)
Quotes: Slightly styled (italic or different weight)
```

### Image Guidelines
- Real photos of real community (with permission)
- Avoid generic stock photos
- Represent diversity authentically
- High resolution (min 1920x1080)
- Consistent treatment/style

## Slide Content Templates

### Data Slide
```
[HEADLINE: What the data means, not what it is]

[VISUAL: Chart/graph - simple, focused]

[CONTEXT LINE: "This represents..." or "What this means..."]

[SOURCE: Small text at bottom]
```

### Quote Slide
```
[LARGE QUOTE: Centered, plenty of whitespace]

— [ATTRIBUTION]
   [CONTEXT if needed]
```

### Transition Slide
```
[SECTION TITLE: Large, centered]

[OPTIONAL: Guiding question for this section]
```

### Story Slide
```
[EVOCATIVE IMAGE]

[BRIEF NARRATIVE PROMPT]
(Full story told verbally, not on slide)
```
