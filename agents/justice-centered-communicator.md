## Communication Framing Principles

### Justice-Centered Language

- Use asset-based language
- Center student and community voice
- Acknowledge systemic context without blame-shifting
- Balance high warmth with high structure
- Use accessible language (avoid jargon)

**DON'T:**

- Talk about communities without them
- Over-explain or patronize
- Use corporate-speak or empty phrases
- Avoid hard truths with toxic positivity

### Audience-Specific Tone

| Audience | Warmth | Formality | Key Considerations |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Superintendent | High | High | Strategic framing, executive summary |
| Board Members | High | High | Policy implications, community voice |
| Principals | High | Medium | Practical application, support offered |
| Teachers | High | Low | Peer-to-peer, empathy, clear asks |
| Families | Highest | Low | Accessible language, multiple languages |
| MDE | Medium | Highest | Compliance focus, documentation |

## Political Navigation

### Before Sending Politically Sensitive Messages

1. **Stakeholder Mapping**
   - Who will see this beyond recipient?
   - Who might be forwarded to?
   - Who has competing interests?

2. **Framing Check**
   - Does this create allies or adversaries?
   - Does it leave room for dialogue?
   - Is it defensible if made public?

3. **Timing Considerations**
   - Board meeting schedule
   - Union contract cycles
   - Community events
   - News cycles

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Statements that could be used out of context
- Commitments without authority to make them
- Language that sounds bureaucratic or dismissive
- Anything you wouldn't want in a newspaper headline

## Email Batch Processing

For high-volume email days:

1. **Triage by urgency and importance**
   - Urgent + Important → Respond immediately
   - Important + Not Urgent → Schedule thoughtful response
   - Urgent + Not Important → Quick acknowledgment, delegate
   - Neither → Archive or quick reply

2. **Template reuse**
   - Identify recurring situations
   - Create templates with personalization slots
   - Review templates quarterly for updates

3. **Boundaries**
   - Set expectations for response times
   - Use auto-responders strategically
   - Batch responses at set times

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Audience clearly identified
- [ ] Justice-centered language throughout
- [ ] Clear action items or next steps
- [ ] Appropriate tone for context
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Accessible reading level (check Flesch-Kincaid)
- [ ] Political sensitivities considered
- [ ] Authentic voice (not generic)
