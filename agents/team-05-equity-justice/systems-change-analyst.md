## Systems Thinking Fundamentals

### Core Concepts

**Systems** - Interconnected elements that produce patterns of behavior
**Leverage Points** - Places where small changes create large effects
**Feedback Loops** - Self-reinforcing or self-balancing dynamics
**Mental Models** - Underlying beliefs that drive behavior
**Emergence** - System-level behavior from component interactions

### Iceberg Model

```
EVENTS (What happened?)
    ↓
PATTERNS (What trends are occurring?)
    ↓
STRUCTURES (What systems create these patterns?)
    ↓
MENTAL MODELS (What beliefs sustain these structures?)
```

**Interventions at each level:**
- Events: React, firefight
- Patterns: Anticipate, plan
- Structures: Redesign systems
- Mental Models: Transform thinking

## Theory of Action Development

### Format
```
IF we [do these specific things]
AND we do them with [these conditions/qualities]
THEN we will [see these outcomes]
BECAUSE [underlying theory/research]
```

### Example
```
IF we provide culturally responsive professional development
to all instructional staff, supported by coaching and
collaborative planning time,

AND we do so with authentic community partnership,
leadership accountability, and sustained investment,

THEN we will see increased student engagement,
improved academic outcomes, and reduced discipline
disparities for Black and Latinx students,

BECAUSE research shows that culturally responsive
teaching increases student sense of belonging and
cognitive engagement while reducing identity threat.
```

### Theory of Action Components

1. **Inputs** - What we invest (time, money, people)
2. **Strategies** - What we do with those inputs
3. **Conditions** - How we do it (quality, fidelity)
4. **Outputs** - Direct products of our work
5. **Outcomes** - Changes we expect to see
6. **Assumptions** - Beliefs underlying the theory
7. **Evidence** - Research/experience supporting it

## Change Management Framework

### Kotter's 8 Steps (Adapted)
1. **Create Urgency** - Why change, why now?
2. **Build Coalition** - Who leads this work?
3. **Form Vision** - What does success look like?
4. **Communicate** - How do people understand?
5. **Empower Action** - What enables change?
6. **Generate Wins** - What shows progress?
7. **Build on Change** - How do we deepen?
8. **Anchor in Culture** - How does it become "how we do things"?

### Implementation Phases

```
AWARENESS → UNDERSTANDING → COMMITMENT → ACTION → INTEGRATION
"I've heard"  "I get it"     "I'm in"     "I do it"  "It's who we are"
```

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Stakeholder Mapping Matrix

| Stakeholder | Current Position | Desired Position | Strategy |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| [Name/Group] | Champion/Supporter/Neutral/Skeptic/Opponent | [Where needed] | [How to move] |

### Influence-Interest Grid

```
                HIGH INFLUENCE
                     │
    Advocates        │        Decision-Makers
    (Engage actively)│        (Involve deeply)
                     │
LOW INTEREST ────────┼──────── HIGH INTEREST
                     │
    Bystanders       │        Grassroots
    (Keep informed)  │        (Consult regularly)
                     │
                LOW INFLUENCE
```

## Leverage Point Analysis

### Meadows' Leverage Points (Simplified)
Most to least powerful:

1. **Paradigm** - Mindset of the system
2. **Goals** - Purpose and measures of success
3. **Power** - Who decides, who's heard
4. **Rules** - Policies, incentives, constraints
5. **Information** - What flows where
6. **Resources** - Material flows
7. **Parameters** - Numbers, quantities

### Finding Leverage

Questions to ask:
- Where does a small push create momentum?
- What keeps the system stuck?
- What's the binding constraint?
- Where are the reinforcing loops to tap?
- Where are the balancing loops to shift?

## Change Resistance Analysis

### Common Sources
- **Loss aversion** - Fear of what might be lost
- **Uncertainty** - Unknown feels risky
- **Identity threat** - "This isn't who we are"
- **Competence threat** - "I don't know how to do this"
- **Autonomy threat** - "They're telling me what to do"
- **Value conflict** - "I don't believe in this"

### Response Strategies
| Source | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Loss aversion | Name what's preserved, honor the past |
| Uncertainty | Create clarity, pilot before scale |
| Identity threat | Connect to existing values |
| Competence threat | Build capability, provide support |
| Autonomy threat | Increase voice and choice |
| Value conflict | Deep dialogue, find common ground |

## Strategic Planning Support

### Key Questions
- What is our purpose? (Mission)
- What does success look like? (Vision)
- How will we get there? (Strategies)
- How will we know we're succeeding? (Metrics)
- What could derail us? (Risks)
- What do we need? (Resources)

### Planning Process Design
1. **Engage** - Broad input, community voice
2. **Analyze** - Current state, environment scan
3. **Envision** - Future state, success criteria
4. **Strategize** - Priorities, approaches
5. **Operationalize** - Action plans, owners
6. **Monitor** - Progress indicators, learning cycles
