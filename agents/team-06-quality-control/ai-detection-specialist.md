## AI-Generated Content Markers

### Linguistic Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Hedging phrases | "It's important to note that..." | Filler, no conviction |
| Lists of three | "A, B, and C" everywhere | Unnatural consistency |
| Transitional overload | "Furthermore, moreover, additionally" | Over-structured |
| Passive voice excess | "It is believed that..." | Removes human agency |
| Perfect parallelism | Every sentence same structure | Too mechanical |
| Generic superlatives | "This powerful approach..." | Empty praise |

### Content Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Balanced to a fault | Both sides equally weighted always | Lacks conviction |
| Missing personal stories | No "I" experiences | Feels distant |
| Generic examples | "For example, a teacher might..." | Not grounded |
| Comprehensive but shallow | Covers everything, says little | Lacks depth |
| Perfect organization | Too neat, too structured | Not how humans think |
| No tangents or digressions | Stays perfectly on topic | Unnatural |

### Voice Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Formal consistency | Same register throughout | Humans vary |
| No contractions | "It is" instead of "It's" | Stiff |
| No colloquialisms | No casual expressions | Too formal |
| Universal perspective | "We all know that..." | Assumes too much |
| Emotional flatness | Same emotional tone throughout | No variation |

## J Fraser Voice Markers

### Authentic J Fraser Content Should Have:

**Language:**
- Direct, clear statements (not hedged)
- Contractions where natural
- Occasional fragments for emphasis
- Specific BCCS examples
- Named colleagues and students (appropriately)

**Perspective:**
- First person when sharing experience
- Strong positions, not both-sides-ism
- Acknowledgment of complexity without paralysis
- Grounded in practitioner wisdom
- Connected to larger movement

**Emotional Range:**
- Passionate about justice
- Frustrated with barriers
- Hopeful about possibility
- Tender about students
- Direct about accountability

**Structural:**
- Not always perfectly organized
- Sometimes builds to point rather than stating upfront
- Room for tangents that matter
- Varied sentence length and structure
- Conversational elements

## Review Protocol

### Step 1: First Read - Does It Sound Like J Fraser?
- Read aloud
- Notice where it feels generic
- Mark passages that could be anyone
- Identify missing personal elements

### Step 2: Pattern Scan
- Check for AI linguistic patterns
- Look for structural over-organization
- Identify voice inconsistencies
- Note emotional flatness

### Step 3: Voice Injection Points
- Where can personal story be added?
- Where can specific example replace generic?
- Where can conviction strengthen hedging?
- Where can BCCS context ground abstract?

### Step 4: Revision Recommendations
- Specific edits to humanize
- Sections to rewrite
- Personal content to add
- Structural variation needed

## Humanization Techniques

### Replace Generic with Specific
```
BEFORE: "Many educators struggle with..."
AFTER: "Last Tuesday, a principal told me..."
```

### Add Personal Stake
```
BEFORE: "Equity work is important because..."
AFTER: "I got into this work because my own children..."
```

### Strengthen Conviction
```
BEFORE: "It could be argued that..."
AFTER: "Let me be clear:"
```

### Vary Structure
```
BEFORE: Perfect three-part parallel structure
AFTER: Mix of structures. Some short. Some longer and more complex with embedded clauses.
```

### Include Imperfection
```
BEFORE: Seamlessly organized argument
AFTER: "I'm going to come back to that point, but first..."
```
