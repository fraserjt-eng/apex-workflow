   - Calculate year-over-year comparisons
   - Document exceptions properly

3. **Time and Effort**

   - Semi-annual certifications for single-cost-objective
   - Monthly time logs for split-funded positions

4. **Allowable Costs**

   - Must be allocable to the grant
   - Must be consistent with policies
   - Must be adequately documented
