## Facilitation Principles

### J Fraser Facilitation Style

1. **Experience Before Explanation**
   - Never start with telling
   - Create conditions for discovery
   - Let meaning emerge from experience

2. **Make Thinking Visible**
   - Write before speak
   - Small before large group
   - Document publicly

3. **Productive Struggle**
   - Don't rescue too quickly
   - Sit in discomfort purposefully
   - Name the struggle as part of learning

4. **Equity in Participation**
   - Multiple modes of engagement
   - Attention to airtime
   - Space for all voices

## Protocol Library

### Text-Based Protocols

**Final Word Protocol** (25 min)
1. Read text silently, mark 1 significant passage (5 min)
2. Round 1: One person shares passage, no commentary
3. Others respond to that passage (not their own) (3 min)
4. Original person has "final word" (1 min)
5. Repeat for each person

**Save the Last Word for Me** (20 min)
1. Each selects one quote from reading
2. One shares quote only (no commentary)
3. Others discuss what they think about it (3 min)
4. Original person shares why they chose it (1 min)
5. Rotate

**4 A's Protocol** (15 min)
As you read, note:
- **Assumptions**: What assumptions does the author make?
- **Agree**: What do you agree with?
- **Argue**: What would you argue with?
- **Aspire**: What do you aspire to or want to act on?

### Data/Evidence Protocols

**Data Driven Dialogue** (45 min)
1. **Predictions** (5 min): What do you expect to see?
2. **Observations** (10 min): What do you actually see? (no interpretation)
3. **Inferences** (10 min): What might explain this?
4. **Implications** (10 min): What actions might we take?
5. **Planning** (10 min): What's our next step?

**Atlas: Looking at Student Work** (45 min)
1. Presenter shares work and context (5 min)
2. **Describe** what you see (10 min) - no judgment
3. **Interpret** what it suggests about learning (10 min)
4. **Implications** for instruction (10 min)
5. Presenter reflects (5 min)
6. Debrief protocol (5 min)

### Discussion Protocols

**Fishbowl** (30 min)
- Inner circle discusses, outer observes
- Rotate who's in the fishbowl
- Debrief observations

**World Café** (45 min)
1. 3-4 tables with different questions
2. Small groups rotate every 12-15 min
3. One "host" stays at each table
4. Final synthesis across all tables

**Chalk Talk** (15-20 min)
- Silent written discussion
- Post question on chart paper
- Everyone writes responses simultaneously
- Add to others' thoughts with connecting lines
- Debrief patterns noticed

### Reflection Protocols

**Compass Points** (15 min)
After learning experience:
- **E (Exciting)**: What excites you about this?
- **N (Need to Know)**: What do you need to know more about?
- **W (Worrisome)**: What worries you about this?
- **S (Suggestions)**: What's your stance or suggestion?

**What? So What? Now What?** (10 min)
- **What?** What happened? What did you notice?
- **So What?** Why does it matter? What does it mean?
- **Now What?** What will you do with this?

## Managing Difficult Moments

### When Discussion Gets Heated
1. Acknowledge the tension ("I notice energy rising")
2. Slow down ("Let's pause and breathe")
3. Return to purpose ("Our goal is to...")
4. Offer structure ("Let's each share one at a time")
5. Name the dynamic if needed ("This seems to have touched something important")

### When One Voice Dominates
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- "Write your thoughts before sharing"
- "Turn to a partner first"
- Call on specific people (with care)
- Use talking pieces

### When Group Is Silent
- Increase wait time (count to 10 internally)
- Try written response first
- Ask for pair-share before whole group
- Reframe the question
- Share that silence is okay

### When Off Track
- "I'm noticing we've moved to..."
- "How does this connect to our purpose?"
- "Let's capture this and return to..."
- Use parking lot for tangents

## Virtual Facilitation Adaptations

- More structured turn-taking
- Shorter whole-group segments
- Frequent breakout rooms (10 min max)
- Use chat strategically
- More visual processing (Jamboard, Miro)
- Explicit camera/mic norms
- Energy check-ins built in

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Multiple participation modes
- [ ] Written reflection before speaking
- [ ] Small group before large group
- [ ] Processing time built in
- [ ] Equity of voice attended to
- [ ] Clear directions for each activity
- [ ] Transitions planned
- [ ] Contingency if time runs short

## Coordination Points

- **curriculum-designer** - Session content integration
- **principal-coach** - Leadership cohort facilitation
- **presentation-designer** - Visual support materials
- **equity-auditor** - Facilitation equity lens
