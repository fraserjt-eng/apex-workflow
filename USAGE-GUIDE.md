# APEX Usage Guide: Transforming Your Work

**For J Fraser, Director of Educational Equity**

This guide shows you how to use APEX to amplify your impact across all four portfolios while staying grounded in justice-centered principles.

---

## Quick Start

### Daily Activation
```
/apex:scan
```
Run this Monday mornings at 7:30am. APEX reviews all four portfolios, surfaces deadlines, identifies synergies, and recommends your focus for the week.

### Before Any Teaching/Learning Work
```
/apex:pedagogy
```
This activates your signature protocol. APEX ensures all PD content follows Experience → Analysis → Framework and includes mirror work.

---

### Scenario 2: Designing a PD Session

```
You: I need a 2-hour PD on culturally responsive practices for principals

APEX: /apex:pedagogy activated

curriculum-designer: Building session structure...

## Culturally Responsive Leadership PD
Duration: 2 hours

### 1. EXPERIENTIAL ENTRY (20 min)
Principals will experience a "cultural mismatch" simulation
where instructions are given in unfamiliar patterns...

### 2. COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS (35 min)
Small groups process: What did you notice? What emotions came up?
Large group: Surface patterns across groups...

### 3. MIRROR WORK (15 min)
Personal reflection: Where in YOUR school might students
experience similar cultural mismatch? (Not shared publicly)

### 4. FRAMEWORK (25 min)
NOW introduce Hammond's Ready for Rigor...
Connect to what they discovered in simulation...

### 5. APPLICATION (20 min)
Each principal identifies ONE practice to examine this week...

### 6. COMMITMENT (5 min)
Public commitment: "This week I will..."

---
quality-control-lead: Validating pedagogy protocol...
✅ Experience before framework
✅ Mirror work included
✅ High warmth + high structure
✅ Application opportunity
```

### Scenario 3: Rapid Response Needed

```
You: Superintendent needs talking points for media interview in 1 hour - about our suspension data

APEX: /apex:rapid activated

⏱️ RAPID MODE - 1 hour deadline
Essential standards only

justice-centered-communicator: Drafting talking points...

## Media Talking Points: Suspension Data

**Lead with assets:**
"Brooklyn Center has made significant progress in reducing
exclusionary discipline over the past three years..."

**Acknowledge the work ahead:**
"We recognize that disproportionality persists, and we're
actively implementing restorative practices..."

**Specific actions:**
"This year we've trained 100% of staff in restorative
circles and reduced out-of-school suspensions by 23%..."

**Redirect to students:**
"Every student deserves to be in class learning. Our focus
is keeping students connected to their education..."

---
✅ FERPA compliant (no student names)
✅ Asset-based framing
✅ Factually accurate
⚠️ Full QC review recommended before external use
```

### Scenario 4: Equity Audit with Data

```
You: Run disproportionality analysis on our discipline data

APEX: /apex:equity activated

equity-auditor: Running analysis...

$ python disproportionality.py --data discipline.csv --group race --outcome suspended

================================================================
DISPROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
Outcome: suspended
================================================================

Group                     Pop %   Out %    Rate   Ratio  Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black                     35.2%   62.4%   12.3%   1.77x  Overrepresented !
Hispanic                  28.1%   18.2%    4.5%   0.65x  Underrepresented
White                     22.3%   12.1%    3.8%   0.54x  Significantly under
Asian                      8.4%    4.2%    3.5%   0.50x  Significantly under
Multi-racial               6.0%    3.1%    3.6%   0.52x  Significantly under

================================================================
GROUPS REQUIRING ATTENTION:
  - Black: 1.77x overrepresentation (124 of 352 students)
================================================================

data-analyst: Contextualizing findings...

This pattern suggests systemic factors in discipline referrals,
not student behavior differences. Recommend examining:
1. Which staff members make most referrals
2. Time of day patterns
3. Location patterns (classroom vs. hallway)
4. Type of infraction by demographic

| Equity Language | After file save | Deficit terms, suggests alternatives |
| Pedagogy Check | After file save | Missing elements in PD content |

Remove PII before proceeding.
```
