# The Four Pivots (Shawn Ginwright, 2022)

## Overview

The Four Pivots offers a healing-centered approach to social change that prioritizes personal transformation as foundational to systemic transformation. It challenges burnout culture and transactional approaches to justice work.

## Pivot 1: Lens to Mirror

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Analyzing external systems and other people's problems
- TO: Examining our own patterns, complicity, and transformation

**Key Insight:** We can't heal what we won't feel

**Questions:**
- What patterns in me contribute to this problem?
- Where is my complicity in the system I critique?
- What is my own healing work?
- How do I participate in what I criticize?

**Application:** Before critiquing others or systems, ask "How do I show up in this?"

**In BCCS Context:**
- Before asking teachers to examine bias, what bias work have I done?
- Before critiquing systems, what am I perpetuating?
- What healing do I need to be effective in this role?

## Pivot 2: Transaction to Transformation

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Compliance, accountability metrics, fixing others
- TO: Deep relationships, mutual growth, becoming together

**Key Insight:** You can't have transformation through just transactional relationships

**Questions:**
- Am I changed by this interaction?
- Is this transactional efficiency or transformational depth?
- What relationship am I building?
- Do people experience me as genuinely caring or checking boxes?

**Application:** Move beyond "doing to" toward "being with"

**In BCCS Context:**
- Are PD sessions transactional (sit and get) or transformational (deep engagement)?
- Do principals feel supported or surveilled?
- Are family engagement efforts genuine partnership or compliance theater?

## Pivot 3: Problem to Possibility

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Deficit focus, gap analysis, what's wrong
- TO: Asset focus, imagination, what could be

**Key Insight:** What we focus on, grows

**Questions:**
- Am I leading from what's possible or what's wrong?
- Where is my language deficit-focused?
- When did I last ask "what if?" instead of "what's broken?"
- How do I hold both honest assessment AND hopeful imagination?

**Application:** Shift from "what's wrong" to "what's possible"

**In BCCS Context:**
- Do our equity conversations focus on gaps or assets?
- Are we imagining new possibilities or just fixing old problems?
- Where is joy in our professional community?

## Pivot 4: Hustle to Flow

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Urgency, overwork, martyrdom, grind culture
- TO: Sustainable rhythm, rest as resistance, well-being as effectiveness

**Key Insight:** Urgency is a form of violence

**Questions:**
- Where is urgency driving my decisions instead of wisdom?
- Am I modeling sustainability or martyrdom?
- What message does my pace send to those I lead?
- What do I need to stop doing to be effective?

**Application:** Recognize urgency as white supremacy culture tool

**In BCCS Context:**
- Are we adding initiatives without removing anything?
- Do we expect burnout levels of effort?
- What would sustainable equity work look like?

## Applying the Pivots in Practice

### In Professional Development Design

| Pivot | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Lens -> Mirror | Include personal reflection before system analysis |
| Transaction -> Transformation | Build in relationship time (not optional) |
| Problem -> Possibility | Start with appreciation and imagination |
| Hustle -> Flow | Don't overstuff; build in processing time |

### Daily Leadership Check

1. Have I looked in the mirror today? (Pivot 1)
2. Am I building relationship or just completing tasks? (Pivot 2)
3. Am I focused on problems or possibilities? (Pivot 3)
4. Am I modeling sustainable pace? (Pivot 4)

## Common Misapplications

| What It's NOT | What It IS |
|--------------|------------|
| Avoiding accountability | Holding accountability with care |
| Ignoring problems | Seeing problems through asset lens |
| Doing nothing | Doing less, better |
| Navel-gazing | Self-work that enables other-work |
| Being soft | Being sustainable |

## Key Quotes
