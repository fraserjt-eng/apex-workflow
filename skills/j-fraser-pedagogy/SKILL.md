# J FRASER PEDAGOGY PROTOCOL

> "The students deserve better than our confident distortions."
> — The Logic Trap

## GROUNDING: The Interior Architecture

This pedagogy is grounded in the *Interior Architecture of Transformation* framework, which identifies the cognitive structures that prevent clear thinking and authentic action:

| Book | Core Insight | Pedagogical Application |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| The Logic Trap | Three Grooves distort perception | Interrupt evidence, attribution, prediction grooves |
| Projecting Proof | We manufacture evidence for beliefs | Ask "What is my evidence?" |
| The Agency Shift | Fear freezes action despite clarity | Build capacity to act before ready |
| The Unmasking Spiral | Transformation never ends | Reject arrival, embrace the spiral |

**See:** `references/interior-architecture.md` for complete framework

## MANDATORY: Ask These Questions First

Before proceeding with any teaching/learning/leading work, ask:

1. **Audience Context:** Who specifically will engage with this content? What's their current understanding? What resistance might they have?

2. **Experience Entry:** What concrete experience will we start with BEFORE any framework or theory? (Critical: Experience → Analysis → Framework, never reverse)

3. **Mirror Work Integration:** Where will participants examine their own complicity, not just critique external systems? Which groove (evidence, attribution, prediction) are they most likely stuck in?

4. **Street Data Connection:** What experiential, community-generated data will ground this? How will we weight it against satellite data?

5. **Transformation Goal:** What specific shift in thinking or practice should *begin*? (Not "result" — there is no arrival)

6. **Interior Architecture Check:** What distortions am I bringing to this design? What is my evidence for my assumptions about this audience?

## Core Principles

### 1. High Warmth + High Structure (Both Required)

This is non-negotiable. Never sacrifice one for the other.

```
                    HIGH STRUCTURE
                         │
    RIGID COMPLIANCE     │     THRIVING COMMUNITY
    (Low Warmth,         │     (High Warmth,
     High Structure)     │      High Structure)
                         │        ← TARGET
                         │
LOW WARMTH ──────────────┼────────────── HIGH WARMTH
                         │
    CHAOS                │     COMFORTABLE DECLINE
    (Low Warmth,         │     (High Warmth,
     Low Structure)      │      Low Structure)
                         │
                    LOW STRUCTURE
```

**In Practice:**
- Explicit expectations delivered with genuine care
- Clear accountability without shame
- Firm boundaries with relational grounding
- High standards as an expression of belief in capacity

### 2. Experience → Analysis → Framework (Never Reverse)

**The Order Matters:**

```
WRONG: Here's Ginwright's Four Pivots. Now let's apply them.
RIGHT: Let's experience this scenario... What did you notice?
       What patterns emerged? Now let me give you language for that.
```

**Why This Order:**
- Frameworks become tools, not tests
- Learning is discovered, not delivered
- Resistance decreases when insight precedes label
- Retention increases when meaning is constructed

### 3. Mirror Before Lens

**Before analyzing systems, examine self:**
- "What patterns do I perpetuate?"
- "Where am I complicit?"
- "What do I need to unlearn?"

**The Sequence:**
1. Personal reflection (mirror)
2. Interpersonal examination (window)
3. Systemic analysis (lens)

**Without mirror work:**
- Critique becomes self-righteous
- Change is externalized
- Transformation stays theoretical

**Interior Architecture Enhancement:**
Traditional mirror work asks: *"Where am I complicit?"*
Enhanced mirror work adds:
1. **Evidence Check:** "What is my evidence for what I believe about this situation?"
2. **Groove Interruption:** "Which groove (evidence, attribution, prediction) might be distorting my view?"
3. **Spiral Position:** "Have I encountered this pattern before at a shallower level?"
4. **Expert/Practitioner Check:** "Am I analyzing this, or am I in it?"

### 4. Asset-Based Without Avoidance

**Both Required:**
- Lead with community strengths and cultural wealth
- AND name specific harms and barriers

**What This Looks Like:**

```
TOXIC POSITIVITY: "Our community is so resilient!"
                  (Ignoring the harm that creates need for resilience)

DEFICIT FRAMING: "These students are so far behind."
                 (Ignoring assets, centering gaps)

ASSET-BASED HONEST: "Our students bring rich linguistic assets.
                     AND our system has failed to recognize these,
                     causing real harm we must address."
```

### 5. Street Data Weighted Equally

**Satellite Data (Quantitative):**
- Test scores, attendance rates, discipline data
- Important but incomplete

**Street Data (Experiential):**
- Student experience, family voice, teacher observation
- Equally weighted, not supplementary

**In Practice:**
- "The MCA scores show X. But when we shadowed students, we saw Y."
- "Discipline data indicates Z. In family focus groups, we heard..."
- Never present satellite data without street data context

### 6. The Spiral (No Arrival)

**Core truth:** Transformation is not a destination but a spiral. Participants will return to the same issues at deeper levels.

**Implications for design:**
- Never frame learning as "complete" or "done"
- Include "What's next?" not just "What did you learn?"
- Acknowledge that today's insight will need revisiting
- Reject checkbox completion

**Session closing language:**
> "You are not finished. What you learned today will return at a deeper level. The work continues."

**The Expert Trap:**
When we facilitate, we risk becoming experts who describe transformation rather than practitioners who undergo it. Ask regularly: "When did I last sit in a circle as participant, not facilitator?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Lecture first | Feels efficient | Trust the process |
| Skip mirror work | Feels uncomfortable | Name the discomfort |
| Generic examples | Easier to prepare | Use real BCCS examples |

| All structure, no warmth | Task-focused | Lead with relationship |
| Satellite only | Data is available | Actively seek street data |
| Performative critique | Easier than self-exam | Return to mirror |

## Facilitator Phrases

### Opening
- "Let's start with an experience..."
- "Before we name anything, let's notice..."
- "What's alive for you as you enter this space?"

### Deepening
- "What patterns are you seeing?"
- "Where is this showing up in your practice?"
- "What's the hardest truth here?"

### Mirror Work
- "Before we look at the system, look at yourself..."
- "Where might you be complicit in this pattern?"
- "What do you need to unlearn?"

### Framework Connection
- "Now let me give you some language for what you discovered..."
- "Researchers call this..."
- "Here's a framework that might help..."

### Closing
- "What will you do differently tomorrow?"
- "Who will you tell about this commitment?"
- "What support do you need?"

## Application Examples

### Bad Example: Traditional PD
```
Topic: Culturally Responsive Teaching

9:00 - Welcome, introduce Hammond's framework
9:30 - Show Ready for Rigor model
10:00 - Discuss how to apply it
10:30 - Plan an activity
11:00 - Share out and close
```

### Good Example: J Fraser Approach
```
Topic: Culturally Responsive Teaching

9:00 - Story: Student experience of being invisible
9:15 - Small group: When have you felt unseen? What helped?
9:30 - Mirror work: Write about a time you may have made
       a student feel unseen (private reflection)
9:45 - Pair share (optional): What did you notice?
10:00 - Framework: Hammond's levels of culture
        Connected to what groups discovered
10:30 - Application: Plan one specific change for Monday
10:45 - Commitment: Share with accountability partner
11:00 - Close: What's one word for how you're leaving?
```

The difference: Experience → Analysis → Framework, with mirror work and commitment.
