# THE FOUR PIVOTS

**Source:** Shawn Ginwright, Ph.D. - *The Four Pivots: Reimagining Justice, Reimagining Ourselves* (2022)

## Overview

The Four Pivots offers a healing-centered approach to social change that prioritizes personal transformation as foundational to systemic transformation. It challenges burnout culture and transactional approaches to justice work.

## The Four Pivots

### Pivot 1: From Lens to Mirror

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Analyzing external systems and others
- TO: Examining our own patterns, wounds, and complicity

**Key Concepts:**
- We can't heal what we won't feel
- Personal healing enables collective healing
- Leaders must do their own work first
- Self-reflection is not self-indulgence

**Application Questions:**
- What patterns in my leadership mirror the very things I critique?
- What wounds am I carrying that affect my work?
- Where am I avoiding my own growth while demanding it of others?
- How does my healing (or lack of it) impact those I lead?

**In BCCS Context:**
- Before asking teachers to examine bias, what bias work have I done?
- Before critiquing systems, what am I perpetuating?
- What healing do I need to be effective in this role?

### Pivot 2: From Transaction to Transformation

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Compliance, accountability metrics, fixing others
- TO: Deep relationships, mutual growth, becoming together

**Key Concepts:**
- You can't have transformation through just transactional relationships
- Relationships are the unit of change
- Slow down to speed up
- People over programs

**Application Questions:**
- Am I building relationships or managing compliance?
- Do people experience me as genuinely caring or checking boxes?
- Where have I prioritized efficiency over connection?
- What would transformation (not just transaction) look like here?

**In BCCS Context:**
- Are PD sessions transactional (sit and get) or transformational (deep engagement)?
- Do principals feel supported or surveilled?
- Are family engagement efforts genuine partnership or compliance theater?

### Pivot 3: From Problem to Possibility

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Deficit focus, gap analysis, what's wrong
- TO: Asset focus, imagination, what could be

**Key Concepts:**
- We've been trained to find problems, not possibilities
- What we focus on, grows
- Imagination is a form of resistance
- Joy is a strategy, not a luxury

**Application Questions:**
- Am I leading from what's possible or what's wrong?
- Where is my language deficit-focused?
- When did I last ask "what if?" instead of "what's broken?"
- How do I hold both honest assessment AND hopeful imagination?

**In BCCS Context:**
- Do our equity conversations focus on gaps or assets?
- Are we imagining new possibilities or just fixing old problems?
- Where is joy in our professional community?
- How do we name reality without losing hope?

### Pivot 4: From Hustle to Flow

**The Shift:**
- FROM: Urgency, overwork, martyrdom, grind culture
- TO: Sustainable pace, rest as resistance, well-being as effectiveness

**Key Concepts:**
- Urgency is a form of violence
- We can't pour from an empty cup
- Rest is not a reward; it's a requirement
- Sustainable movements require sustainable people

**Application Questions:**
- Where is urgency driving my decisions instead of wisdom?
- Am I modeling sustainability or martyrdom?
- What message does my pace send to those I lead?
- What do I need to stop doing to be effective?

**In BCCS Context:**
- Are we adding initiatives without removing anything?
- Do we expect burnout levels of effort?
- How do we create space for teachers to be human?
- What would sustainable equity work look like?

## Applying the Pivots

### In Professional Development Design

**Lens → Mirror:**
- Include personal reflection before system analysis
- Ask "where do I show up in this?" before "what's wrong with the system?"

**Transaction → Transformation:**
- Build in relationship time (not optional)
- Focus on who participants are becoming, not just what they're doing

**Problem → Possibility:**
- Start sessions with appreciation, aspiration, imagination
- Balance honest assessment with creative visioning

**Hustle → Flow:**
- Don't overstuff sessions
- Build in processing time
- Model sustainable pacing

### In Leadership Practice

**Daily Check:**
- Have I looked in the mirror today? (Pivot 1)
- Am I building relationship or just completing tasks? (Pivot 2)
- Am I focused on problems or possibilities? (Pivot 3)
- Am I modeling sustainable pace? (Pivot 4)

**Meeting Design:**
- Begin with check-in that invites whole person (Pivot 2)
- Include appreciation before problems (Pivot 3)
- End on time, respect boundaries (Pivot 4)
- Allow space for honest reflection (Pivot 1)

### In Organizational Change

**Initiative Evaluation:**
- Does this help people heal or just comply? (Pivot 2)
- Are we adding without removing? (Pivot 4)
- Does this build on assets or just address deficits? (Pivot 3)
- Does this require leaders to do their own work? (Pivot 1)

## Common Misapplications

| What It's NOT | What It IS |
|--------------|------------|
| Avoiding accountability | Holding accountability with care |
| Ignoring problems | Seeing problems through asset lens |
| Doing nothing | Doing less, better |
| Navel-gazing | Self-work that enables other-work |
| Being soft | Being sustainable |

## Key Quotes

> "We can't heal what we won't feel."

> "You can't have transformation through just transactional relationships."

> "What we focus on grows."

> "Rest is not a reward; it's a requirement."

> "Healing is not an individual act—it's a communal process."

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### With Street Data (Safir & Dugan)
- Both center relationships and listening
- Street data as mirror work for organizations
- Qualitative experience matters

### With Culturally Responsive Teaching (Hammond)
- Both emphasize relationship as foundation
- Ready for Rigor requires Pivot 2 (transformation)
- Both challenge urgency culture

### With Restorative Practices
- Both prioritize healing over punishment
- Both build community through relationship
- Both require mirror work first

## Facilitation Notes

When introducing the Four Pivots:
1. **Don't just explain**—create experience of each pivot
2. **Start with Pivot 1**—personal reflection
3. **Name resistance**—some will see this as "soft"
4. **Connect to outcomes**—sustainable change requires this
5. **Model it**—don't teach from a hustle stance about hustle
