# CLEAR AND CARE FRAMEWORK

## Overview

Clear and Care is Brooklyn Center Community Schools' organizational culture framework that emphasizes both explicit expectations (Clear) and genuine relationships (Care). Like J Fraser's pedagogy principle of "High Warmth + High Structure," Clear and Care requires both elements to be present simultaneously.

## The Framework

```
                HIGH CARE
                    │
   ENABLING         │        THRIVING
   (High Care,      │        (High Care,
    Low Clear)      │         High Clear)
                    │            ← GOAL
                    │
LOW CLEAR ──────────┼────────── HIGH CLEAR
                    │
   NEGLECTING       │        DEMANDING
   (Low Care,       │        (Low Care,
    Low Clear)      │         High Clear)
                    │
                LOW CARE
```

## Four Quadrants

### Thriving (High Clear + High Care) ✓ GOAL

**Characteristics:**
- Expectations are explicit and understood
- Relationships are genuine and strong
- Accountability comes with support
- People feel valued AND know what's expected
- Feedback is regular and constructive
- Success is celebrated, growth is supported

**What it sounds like:**
- "Here's exactly what I need, and I know you can do it."
- "I'm going to be direct because I care about your growth."
- "Let's talk about how to get you the support to succeed."

**What it feels like:**
- Safe to take risks
- Clear about direction
- Supported in challenges
- Valued as a person
- Part of something meaningful

### Enabling (High Care, Low Clear)

**Characteristics:**
- Relationships are warm but expectations vague
- Avoiding hard conversations to preserve comfort
- Low accountability because "we care"
- People feel liked but unsure of direction
- Problems persist because they're not addressed

**Warning signs:**
- "I don't want to hurt their feelings"
- Avoiding performance conversations
- Lowering expectations for struggling people
- Celebrating effort without outcomes

**The trap:**
This feels kind but isn't. Without clarity, people can't succeed. Avoiding hard truths harms more than helps.

### Demanding (High Clear, Low Care)

**Characteristics:**
- Expectations are clear but relationships cold
- Compliance without connection
- Accountability feels punitive
- People know what to do but don't feel valued
- High performance short-term, low retention

**Warning signs:**
- "Results are all that matter"
- Feedback without relationship
- Expectations without support
- Tasks over people

**The trap:**
This might produce results but at human cost. Without care, clear becomes controlling.

### Neglecting (Low Clear, Low Care)

**Characteristics:**
- Neither expectations nor relationships
- People left to figure things out
- No accountability, no support
- Confusion and disconnection
- Survival mode, not thriving

**Warning signs:**
- Inconsistent messaging
- Avoiding all feedback
- No connection, no direction
- "Just get it done somehow"

## Practicing Clear

### What "Clear" Looks Like

**In expectations:**
- Specific, observable outcomes defined
- Success criteria explicit
- Timeline and milestones stated
- Non-negotiables distinguished from preferences
- How to get help explained

**In communication:**
- Direct language (not hints or suggestions)
- Say what you mean, mean what you say
- Repeat important messages
- Check for understanding
- Put important things in writing

**In feedback:**
- Specific behaviors, not general impressions
- Impact explained
- Expectations for change clear
- Support offered
- Follow-up scheduled

### Clear Statements Template

```
"The expectation is [specific behavior/outcome].
This matters because [impact/reason].
What I need to see is [observable evidence].
Support available includes [resources].
Let's check in [timeline]."
```

## Practicing Care

### What "Care" Looks Like

**In relationships:**
- Know people as whole humans
- Remember and reference personal details
- Check in without agenda
- Be present and attentive
- Show up during hard times

**In communication:**
- Listen to understand, not respond
- Ask questions with curiosity
- Acknowledge emotions
- Validate experience
- Express genuine interest

**In accountability:**
- Assume positive intent
- Provide context for expectations
- Offer support before judgment
- Celebrate growth and effort
- Maintain dignity always

### Care Practices

**Regular connection:**
- Greet by name
- Ask about life outside work
- Remember important dates/events
- Follow up on things shared
- Express genuine appreciation

**During difficulty:**
- Lead with empathy
- Acknowledge the hard
- Ask what support looks like
- Maintain presence
- Follow through on commitments

## Integration: Clear AND Care

### The Hard Conversation Example

**Enabling (High Care, Low Clear):**
"How's it going? I know things have been tough. Don't worry, we'll figure it out."
(Avoids the issue entirely)

**Demanding (High Clear, Low Care):**
"Your performance is unacceptable. You need to improve immediately or there will be consequences."
(All clarity, no relationship)

**Clear AND Care:**
"I want to have a direct conversation because I care about your success here. I've noticed [specific issue], which impacts [outcome]. This matters to me because I believe in your potential. What I need to see is [clear expectation]. What support do you need to get there? Let's meet again in two weeks to check progress."

### Daily Practice

| Situation | Clear | Care |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Assignment | Specific expectations, timeline | Context, offer support |
| Feedback | Direct, specific, behavioral | Private, dignity-preserving |
| Check-in | Progress on goals | Personal connection first |
| Conflict | Name the issue directly | Listen fully, assume positive intent |
| Recognition | Specific praise for specific actions | Genuine, personal |

## Clear and Care in BCCS Context

### For School Leaders
- Set clear expectations for staff with care for their growth
- Give feedback that's direct AND supportive
- Hold high standards while providing high support
- Build relationships that enable accountability

### For District Leadership
- Communicate direction clearly to schools
- Support principals through challenges
- Hold accountability with compassion
- Model Clear and Care in all interactions

### For Classroom Teachers
- Expectations explicit AND relationships strong
- Discipline with dignity
- High standards with high support
- Know students as whole people

### For Team Culture
- Norms that are clear and lived
- Conflict addressed directly and respectfully
- Celebration and accountability together
- Care that enables honesty

## Common Challenges

### "But they're going through a hard time..."
Care means supporting them through it, not avoiding expectations. Clear means being honest about what's needed. Together: "I see how hard this is. AND this is what we need. How can I help you get there?"

### "They know what I expect..."
Clear means explicit, not assumed. Check for understanding. Put it in writing. Care means helping them succeed at the expectation.

### "I don't want to damage the relationship..."
Avoiding hard truths damages relationships more. Direct feedback given with care strengthens relationships.

### "I'm just focused on results..."
Results without relationship aren't sustainable. Care creates the conditions for sustained performance.

## Self-Assessment

### Am I being Clear?
- Have I stated expectations explicitly?
- Does the person know what success looks like?
- Are timelines and milestones defined?
- Have I checked for understanding?

### Am I showing Care?
- Do I know this person as a whole human?
- Have I listened to understand their context?
- Am I offering genuine support?
- Does my tone convey respect and belief in them?

### Am I integrating both?
- Am I avoiding hard truths to be "nice"?
- Am I being harsh in pursuit of "clarity"?
- Do expectations come with support?
- Does accountability preserve dignity?
