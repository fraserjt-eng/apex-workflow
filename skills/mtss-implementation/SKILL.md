# MULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS (MTSS)

## Overview

MTSS is a framework for providing all students with the best opportunities to succeed academically and behaviorally. It focuses on prevention, early identification, and research-based interventions at increasing levels of intensity.

## The Three Tiers

```
         ┌─────────────────────┐
         │     TIER 3          │  5% of students
         │   Intensive         │  Individual interventions
         │   Individual        │  Frequent progress monitoring
         └─────────┬───────────┘
                   │
         ┌─────────┴───────────┐
         │     TIER 2          │  15% of students
         │   Targeted          │  Small group interventions
         │   Small Group       │  Regular progress monitoring
         └─────────┬───────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────┴──────────────────┐
│            TIER 1                    │  80% of students
│         Universal                    │  Core instruction
│         All Students                 │  Universal screening
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tier 1: Universal Core Instruction

**Who:** All students (100%)
**What:** High-quality, research-based core instruction
**How Often:** Daily, within regular instruction
**Goal:** Meet needs of at least 80% of students

**Key Elements:**
- Differentiated instruction
- Universal screening (3x/year)
- Research-based core curriculum
- Culturally responsive practices
- Proactive behavioral supports

**Equity Consideration:**
- If Tier 1 isn't working for 80%, strengthen Tier 1
- Don't over-identify students for tiers when core needs strengthening
- Examine Tier 1 for cultural responsiveness

### Tier 2: Targeted Intervention

**Who:** Students not responding to Tier 1 (10-15%)
**What:** Small group intervention + Tier 1
**How Often:** 2-5x per week, 20-40 minutes
**Goal:** Accelerate growth to close gaps

**Key Elements:**
- Standardized, evidence-based interventions
- Small groups (3-6 students)
- Progress monitoring every 1-2 weeks
- Clear entry and exit criteria
- Time-limited (8-12 weeks typical)

**Equity Consideration:**
- Watch for over-representation of certain groups
- Use data to identify systemic patterns
- Ensure intervention matches actual need

### Tier 3: Intensive Individual Intervention

**Who:** Students not responding to Tier 2 (1-5%)
**What:** Individualized, intensive support + Tier 1
**How Often:** Daily, 45-60 minutes
**Goal:** Intensive support to close significant gaps

**Key Elements:**
- Individualized intervention plan
- One-on-one or very small group (1-3)
- Frequent progress monitoring (weekly+)
- May include referral for evaluation
- High-intensity, specialized strategies

**Equity Consideration:**
- Tier 3 is not a pathway to special education
- Examine whether Tiers 1-2 were truly implemented
- Consider systemic barriers before individual diagnosis

## MTSS Essential Components

### 1. Universal Screening
- All students, 3x per year
- Identifies students at risk
- Uses valid, reliable measures
- Informs instruction and intervention

### 2. Progress Monitoring
- Track response to intervention
- Frequency increases with tier
- Use sensitive measures
- Make data-based decisions

### 3. Data-Based Decision Making
- Team-based decisions
- Follow decision rules
- Consider multiple data sources
- Regular review cycles

### 4. Multi-Level Prevention
- Tier 1 prevents problems
- Tier 2 addresses early risk
- Tier 3 provides intensive support
- Integration across tiers

### 5. Infrastructure and Support
- Leadership commitment
- Professional development
- Coaching and feedback
- Resource allocation

## MnMTSS (Minnesota Model)

Minnesota's MTSS framework emphasizes:

### Integrated Framework
- Academic AND behavior/social-emotional
- Not separate silos
- Whole-child approach

### Continuous Improvement
- Data-driven cycles
- Implementation science
- Fidelity monitoring

### Equity Lens
- Examine disproportionality
- Culturally responsive practices
- Community and family engagement

### Six Essential Components (MnMTSS)
1. Multiple Tiers of Intervention
2. Problem-Solving Process
3. Data Evaluation
4. Assessments
5. Fidelity and Evaluation
6. Family/School Partnerships

## Data-Based Decision Making

### Decision Rules Framework

```
TIER 1 → TIER 2 Decision:
- Below benchmark on universal screening AND
- Not responding to differentiated Tier 1 AND
- Gap significant enough to warrant intervention

TIER 2 → TIER 3 Decision:
- Not making adequate progress in Tier 2 AND
- Gap is growing or significant AND
- Tier 2 was implemented with fidelity

Return to Lower Tier Decision:
- Goal achieved OR
- Progress indicates success with less support
```

### Problem-Solving Process

```
1. DEFINE the Problem
   What is the gap between expected and actual performance?
   Be specific and measurable.

2. ANALYZE the Problem
   Why is this happening?
   Consider instruction, curriculum, environment, learner.

3. DEVELOP a Plan
   What intervention will address the root cause?
   How will we implement and monitor?

4. IMPLEMENT and EVALUATE
   Is the intervention working?
   What does progress monitoring show?
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Scheduling Interventions
- Intervention time protected, consistent
- Not during core instruction in area of need
- Not during specials/SEL time for behavior supports
- Sufficient duration and frequency

### Grouping Students
- Flexible groups based on data
- Exit criteria established
- Groups change as students progress
- Avoid permanent tracking

### Intervention Fidelity
- Implemented as designed
- Correct dosage (time, frequency)
- Trained interventionists
- Fidelity monitoring in place

### Progress Monitoring
- Right tool for the skill
- Sensitive to change
- Graphed and visible
- Used for decisions (not just collected)

## Equity in MTSS

### Watch for These Patterns
- Over-identification of certain groups for Tier 2/3
- Different progression rates by group
- Disparate referral patterns
- Tier 3 as pathway to SPED

### Equity-Centered MTSS
- Examine Tier 1 before labeling students
- Use culturally responsive interventions
- Include family/community voice
- Disaggregate data by group
- Address systemic barriers, not just student "deficits"

### Questions to Ask
- Who is over/underrepresented in each tier?
- Are interventions culturally responsive?
- Is our core instruction working for all groups?
- How are we addressing systemic issues?

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| "Wait to fail" before acting | Universal screening identifies need early |
| Tier movement as permanent | Tiers are fluid based on data |
| Interventions instead of core improvement | Strengthen Tier 1 first |
| One-size-fits-all interventions | Match intervention to need |
| Data collection without use | Make decisions based on data |
| MTSS = pathway to SPED | MTSS is prevention-focused |

## Application in BCCS Context

### For School Teams
- Establish clear tiered structures
- Use problem-solving protocols
- Schedule intervention time
- Monitor fidelity and outcomes

### For District Leadership
- Align resources to MTSS model
- Provide professional development
- Support implementation infrastructure
- Monitor equity in implementation

### For Data Analysis
- Track tier movement by group
- Examine disproportionality
- Monitor intervention effectiveness
- Evaluate Tier 1 effectiveness
