# BCCS Communications Standards

All communications from BCCS should embody our commitment to justice-centered education while maintaining professional excellence.

## Language Standards

### Always Use (Asset-Based)

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| At-risk students | Students experiencing systemic barriers |
| Achievement gap | Opportunity gap / Education debt |
| Low-performing | Under-resourced / Underserved |
| Disadvantaged | Historically marginalized |
| Minority | Historically excluded / Global majority |
| Broken home | Diverse family structure |
| Dropout | Pushed out / Early leaver |
| Inner-city | Urban / Under-resourced community |
| Hard-to-reach families | Families underserved by traditional outreach |
| Low-income | Families experiencing economic barriers |
| ESL students | Multilingual learners / Emergent bilinguals |
| Special needs | Students with disabilities / IEP-supported |
| Problem students | Students experiencing challenges |
| Failing school | Under-resourced school |
| Bad neighborhood | Under-invested community |

### Framing Principles

1. **Systems, not individuals:** Attribute gaps to systems, not students/families
2. **Assets first:** Lead with strengths before challenges
3. **Specific, not coded:** Name race/class when relevant, don't hide behind euphemisms
4. **Action-oriented:** Include what we're doing, not just what's wrong
5. **Humanizing:** People first language, dignity preserved

## Tone Calibration by Audience

| Audience | Warmth | Structure | Key Approach |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Families** | High | Medium | Accessible, welcoming, clear action steps, translated |
| **Teachers** | High | High | Professional, validating, specific expectations |
| **Principals** | Medium-High | High | Collegial, strategic, outcome-focused |
| **Board** | Medium | Very High | Formal, data-grounded, policy-aligned |
| **MDE/Compliance** | Medium | Very High | Precise, documented, regulation-referenced |
| **Media** | Medium | High | Accurate, mission-aligned, quotable |
| **Community Partners** | High | Medium | Collaborative, asset-focused, reciprocal |
| **Students** | Very High | Medium | Affirming, clear, youth-appropriate |
