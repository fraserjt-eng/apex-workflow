# Grant Strategy

Write compelling grant narratives that authentically represent BCCS's justice-centered approach while meeting funder requirements.

## Narrative Framework

### 1. Opening (The Why) - 10%
- Lead with community voice (street data)
- Name systemic barriers specifically
- Asset-based description of community
- Clear theory of action

**Example Opening:**
> "When we asked Brooklyn Center families what they needed most, Maria Torres, a parent of three, told us: 'We need schools that see our children's brilliance, not just their challenges.' This grant addresses exactly that—building systems that recognize and develop the genius already present in our community."

### 2. Need Statement - 20%
- Quantitative data with context
- Qualitative stories with permission
- Systems analysis (not deficit framing)
- Specific, measurable gaps

**Framing Principle:** Frame as "opportunity gaps created by systemic underinvestment," never as deficits in students or families.

### 3. Approach/Methods - 35%
- Evidence-based strategies with citations
- Cultural responsiveness embedded throughout
- Community partnership centered
- Sustainability plan from day one
- Clear logic model or theory of action

**Theory of Action Format:**
```
IF we [specific intervention]
THEN [measurable outcome]
BECAUSE [research/evidence base]
```

### 4. Evaluation Plan - 15%
- Equity-focused metrics
- Disaggregated outcomes (always)
- Process AND outcome measures
- Community-defined success indicators
- Formative feedback loops

### 5. Capacity Statement - 10%
- Organizational track record
- Staff qualifications (justice-centered lens)
- Partnership strength
- Fiscal responsibility

### 6. Budget & Sustainability - 10%
- Invest in people over products
- Build capacity, not dependency
- Reasonable indirect rates
- Clear sustainability pathway

## Budget Principles

| Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **People first** | 60-70% to personnel (PD, coaching, community liaisons) |
| **Capacity building** | Training that outlasts the grant |
| **Community benefit** | Direct resources to students/families |
| **Sustainability** | Year 3 should need less grant funding than Year 1 |
| **Indirect reasonable** | Stay within funder limits (typically 10-15%) |

## Compliance Quick Reference

### ESSA Title Programs

| Program | Focus | BCCS Alignment |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Title I** | Academic achievement in high-poverty schools | Equity-focused instruction, family engagement |
| **Title II** | Teacher/leader quality | Culturally responsive PD, coaching |
| **Title III** | English learners | Multilingual support, family outreach |
| **Title IV** | Student support & enrichment | SEL, restorative practices, MTSS |

### MDE Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Needs assessment with disaggregated data
- [ ] Evidence-based intervention selection (Tier 1-4)
- [ ] Stakeholder engagement documentation
- [ ] SMART goals with equity lens
- [ ] Progress monitoring plan
- [ ] Budget aligned to activities
- [ ] Sustainability narrative

### Common Compliance Pitfalls

1. **Supplanting:** Grant funds must supplement, not replace existing spending
2. **Time and effort:** Document staff time on grant activities
3. **Procurement:** Follow federal guidelines for purchases >$10K
4. **Reporting:** Calendar all interim and final report deadlines
5. **Amendments:** Request changes BEFORE spending differs from budget

## Language Alignment

All grant language must:
- Use BCCS asset-based terminology (see `bccs-communications` skill)
- Reference Clear & Care framework where relevant
- Align with strategic plan language
- Reflect Four Pivots philosophy
- Pass equity language review

## Funder Research Template

Before writing any grant:

```markdown
## Funder Profile: [Name]

**Mission alignment:** [How does their mission connect to BCCS?]
**Past awards:** [What have they funded before?]
**Decision makers:** [Who reviews? What are their priorities?]
**Language patterns:** [What terms do they use?]
**Red flags:** [What do they NOT fund?]
**Relationship history:** [Any prior contact?]
**Strategic value:** [Beyond the money, why this funder?]
```
