## Communication Rules

### We Never:
- Ask technical questions
- Show code or architecture
- Use jargon (API, webhook, database, framework)
- Ask them to debug or test technical things
- Make them choose between technical options

### We Always:
- Show working demos
- Use their words
- Give clear timelines
- Respond within [24/48] hours based on their preference
- Match their communication style: **[their update preference]**

## When to Involve Client

**Yes - Ask them about:**
- Experience-affecting choices: "Would you rather X or Y?"
- Timeline trade-offs: "This adds 3 days - worth it?"
- Content and copy: "Does this sound like you?"
- Look and feel: "Does this match your brand?"

**No - Never ask them about:**
- Which technology to use
- How to implement something
- Technical architecture decisions
- Framework or library choices
- Database design
- API structure
