# EQUITY AUDIT FRAMEWORK

## Purpose

An equity audit is a systematic examination of policies, practices, programs, and outcomes to identify how they differentially impact student groups. It moves beyond "are we complying?" to "who is being served and who is being harmed?"

## Five Domains of Educational Equity

### Domain 1: Access Equity

**Question:** Who has access to what opportunities?

**Areas to Examine:**
- Gifted and talented identification and enrollment
- Advanced Placement/IB course enrollment
- Extracurricular participation
- Special programs access
- Technology and resource access
- Facility quality differences

**Key Metrics:**
- Enrollment rates by group in advanced courses
- Participation rates in extracurriculars
- Access to experienced teachers
- Resource allocation per pupil

**Street Data to Gather:**
- Student experience of access
- Family navigation of systems
- Barriers to participation

### Domain 2: Achievement Equity

**Question:** What are outcomes for different groups?

**Areas to Examine:**
- Proficiency rates by group
- Growth rates by group
- Graduation and completion rates
- Post-secondary readiness
- Course completion rates
- Credit accrual patterns

**Key Metrics:**
- MCA proficiency by group
- Graduation rates by group
- Growth percentiles by group
- D/F rates by group

**Street Data to Gather:**
- Student experience of learning
- Teacher expectations by student identity
- Academic identity development

### Domain 3: Discipline Equity

**Question:** Who is being disciplined and how?

**Areas to Examine:**
- Referral patterns by group
- Suspension/expulsion rates by group
- Type of consequence by group
- Classroom removal patterns
- Law enforcement involvement
- Staff reporting patterns

**Key Metrics:**
- Suspension rates by group
- Risk ratios for discipline
- Referrals by time/location/reporter
- Restraint and seclusion data

**Street Data to Gather:**
- Student experience of discipline
- Perceived fairness
- Relationship with disciplining adults
- Impact on belonging and academics

### Domain 4: Climate Equity

**Question:** How do different groups experience school?

**Areas to Examine:**
- Sense of belonging by group
- Perceived safety by group
- Quality of relationships
- Experience of inclusion
- Representation in curriculum
- Cultural responsiveness of environment

**Key Metrics:**
- Climate survey disaggregated
- Attendance patterns by group
- Participation in activities by group
- Staff perception vs. student perception

**Street Data to Gather:**
- Student shadowing experiences
- Focus groups with marginalized students
- Family perception of welcome
- Staff awareness of student experience

### Domain 5: Workforce Equity

**Question:** Does our staff reflect and serve our community?

**Areas to Examine:**
- Staff demographic representation
- Leadership diversity
- Hiring and retention patterns
- Assignment patterns (who teaches whom)
- Professional development access
- Voice and influence in decision-making

**Key Metrics:**
- Staff demographics vs. student demographics
- Retention rates by staff group
- Hiring pipeline demographics
- Leadership representation

**Street Data to Gather:**
- Staff of color experience
- Community perception of staff
- Student desire for representation
- Staff cultural competency self-assessment

## Quantitative Analysis Methods

### Risk Ratio Calculation

```
Risk Ratio = (% of Group X in outcome) / (% of Group X in population)

Example - Suspension Risk Ratio:
- Black students = 30% of population
- Black students = 60% of suspensions
- Risk Ratio = 60% / 30% = 2.0

Interpretation:
- 1.0 = Proportional (expected)
- >1.0 = Overrepresented (concern if > 1.5)
- <1.0 = Underrepresented
```

### Composition Analysis

```
For each student group, calculate:
- % of total enrollment
- % of each outcome category
- Compare and note disparities
```

### Trend Analysis

```
Track over time (minimum 3 years):
- Are gaps growing, shrinking, or stable?
- What interventions coincide with changes?
- What patterns persist?
```

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-4 weeks)
- Define scope and focus
- Assemble audit team (include community)
- Gather existing data
- Develop data collection plan
- Communicate purpose and process

### Phase 2: Data Collection (4-6 weeks)
- Compile quantitative data
- Conduct qualitative data gathering
- Include multiple perspectives
- Document data sources and limitations

### Phase 3: Analysis (2-4 weeks)
- Calculate disproportionality metrics
- Identify patterns across domains
- Connect quantitative and qualitative findings
- Identify root causes (not just symptoms)

### Phase 4: Findings & Recommendations (2 weeks)
- Synthesize findings by domain
- Develop specific recommendations
- Prioritize actions
- Create draft report

### Phase 5: Community Validation (2-4 weeks)
- Share findings with stakeholders
- Gather feedback
- Validate interpretations
- Refine recommendations

### Phase 6: Action Planning (2-4 weeks)
- Develop action steps
- Assign ownership
- Create timeline
- Establish progress monitoring

## Report Structure

### Executive Summary
- Key findings (2-3 paragraphs)
- Priority recommendations (3-5)
- Call to action

### Methodology
- Data sources and periods
- Qualitative methods
- Limitations

### Findings by Domain

For each domain:
- Quantitative data with visualizations
- Qualitative themes with quotes
- Root cause analysis
- Recommendations

### Recommendations
- Immediate actions (0-3 months)
- Short-term actions (3-12 months)
- Long-term actions (1-3 years)
- Implementation considerations

### Appendices
- Full data tables
- Survey instruments
- Detailed methodology

## Equity Audit Principles

### Center Those Most Impacted
- Start with marginalized experiences
- Include community voice throughout
- Validate findings with affected groups
- Co-create solutions

### Name Systems, Not Individuals
- Focus on patterns, not personalities
- Examine policies and practices
- Avoid individual blame
- Identify systemic changes needed

### Balance Accountability with Possibility
- Name hard truths directly
- Maintain hope for change
- Focus on what can be done
- Acknowledge complexity

### Move to Action
- Don't audit without commitment to act
- Include timeline and ownership
- Monitor progress publicly
- Return to community with updates

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Data without community | Include street data throughout |
| Audit without action plan | Commit to action before starting |
| Individual blame | Focus on systems and patterns |
| One-time event | Build ongoing monitoring |
| Leadership-only ownership | Include community in all phases |
| Findings without follow-up | Public progress reporting |

## Application in BCCS Context

### Discipline Equity Audit
- Analyze referral and suspension data by group
- Examine classroom removal patterns
- Interview students about experience
- Review policies for equity impact

- Examine advanced course enrollment
- Analyze special program identification
- Interview families about navigation
- Map resource allocation

### Climate Audit
- Disaggregate climate survey data
- Conduct student focus groups
- Shadow students from different groups
- Observe for cultural responsiveness
