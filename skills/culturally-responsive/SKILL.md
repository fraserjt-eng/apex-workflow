# CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHING

**Source:** Zaretta Hammond - *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain* (2015)

## Core Concept

Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) is a brain-based approach that leverages culture to help all students reach intellectual capacity. It's not about celebrating diversity—it's about igniting learning.

> "Culturally responsive teaching is about using cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them."

## Ready for Rigor Framework

Hammond's framework has four quadrants that build on each other:

```
                    LEARNING PARTNERSHIPS
                           │
    ┌──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┐
    │                      │                      │
    │    AWARENESS         │    LEARNING          │
    │    (Quadrant 1)      │    PARTNERSHIPS      │
    │                      │    (Quadrant 2)      │
    │                      │                      │
PERSONAL────────────────────┼────────────────────────INSTRUCTIONAL
    │                      │                      │
    │    INFORMATION       │    COMMUNITY         │
    │    PROCESSING        │    OF LEARNERS       │
    │    (Quadrant 3)      │    (Quadrant 4)      │
    │                      │                      │
    └──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┘
                           │
                    COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS
```

### Quadrant 1: Awareness

**Focus:** Understanding our own cultural lens and student cultural assets

**Key Practices:**
- Examine own implicit biases
- Understand cultural archetypes in teaching
- Recognize students' cultural funds of knowledge
- Identify cultural mismatch moments

**Reflection Questions:**
- What is my cultural "lens"?
- What assumptions am I making about students?
- What cultural assets am I missing?
- Where might there be cultural mismatch in my practice?

### Quadrant 2: Learning Partnerships

**Focus:** Building authentic relationships that support learning

**Key Practices:**
- Build trust and rapport
- Be a "warm demander"
- Make students feel seen and valued
- Communicate high expectations with support

**The Warm Demander:**
- Establishes a relationship before making demands
- Communicates "I believe you can" alongside "I expect you to"
- Holds high standards while providing support
- Firm but fair, not harsh or permissive

### Quadrant 3: Information Processing

**Focus:** How culture shapes cognitive processing

**Key Practices:**
- Activate prior knowledge
- Use culturally familiar examples
- Build background knowledge when needed
- Support cognitive routines

**Cultural Cognition:**
- Oral cultures often process through talk and movement
- Some cultures prioritize relational thinking
- Processing time varies culturally
- Learning is social for many cultures

### Quadrant 4: Community of Learners

**Focus:** Creating classroom environment that leverages collectivist culture

**Key Practices:**
- Build interdependence, not just independence
- Create collaborative structures
- Foster intellectual discourse
- Develop collective efficacy

## Three Levels of Culture

Hammond distinguishes three levels:

### Surface Culture
- Observable practices: food, dress, music, holidays
- Where most "cultural" activities stop
- Important but insufficient

### Shallow Culture
- Unspoken rules and norms
- Concepts of personal space, eye contact
- Rules about authority and respect
- Often where cultural misunderstanding happens

### Deep Culture
- Tacit knowledge and worldview
- Orientation toward time, relationships, success
- Core values and ways of being
- Most powerful for learning

**Implication:** Surface culture activities (food festivals, heritage months) don't change cognitive access. Deep culture understanding transforms instruction.

## Neuroscience of Learning

Hammond emphasizes brain-based learning:

### The Brain Seeks Safety
- Stress triggers amygdala, shuts down learning
- Cultural mismatch creates threat
- Trust reduces cognitive load
- Relationships create safety

### The Brain Is Wired to Seek Patterns
- New learning must connect to existing knowledge
- Cultural knowledge is rich schema
- Build bridges to prior knowledge

### The Brain Needs Challenge
- Productive struggle grows dendrites
- Too easy doesn't build capacity
- High expectations with support

### The Brain Is Social
- Learning is social for many students
- Talk is a cognitive tool
- Community supports cognition

## Warm Demander vs. Other Stances

| Stance | Care | Expectations | Result |
|--------|------|--------------|--------|
| **Warm Demander** | High | High | Growth |
| Elitist | Low | High | Alienation |
| Pushover | High | Low | Stagnation |
| Negligent | Low | Low | Harm |

**The Warm Demander:**
- "I care about you AND I'm going to push you"
- "You belong here AND you have work to do"
- "I see you AND I expect great things"

## Instructional Practices

### Ignite (Building Cognitive Bridges)
- Connect new learning to cultural knowledge
- Use relevant, engaging hooks
- Activate prior knowledge
- Build background when needed

### Chunk (Managing Cognitive Load)
- Break content into manageable pieces
- Provide processing time
- Use graphic organizers
- Build in movement and talk

### Chew (Deepening Understanding)
- Discussion and discourse
- Application to relevant contexts
- Connections across content
- Student-generated examples

### Review (Consolidating Learning)
- Multiple exposures
- Retrieval practice
- Transfer opportunities
- Celebration of growth

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| CRT is about cultural activities | It's about leveraging culture for cognition |
| It's for students of color | It's for all students, especially those underserved |
| It's about lowering standards | It's about providing access to rigor |
| It replaces good instruction | It enhances and deepens good instruction |
| It's political | It's pedagogical—about the brain and learning |

## Application in BCCS Context

### For Professional Development
- Start with Quadrant 1 (awareness work)
- Build toward warm demander capacity
- Connect to neuroscience research
- Practice with real student examples

### For Instructional Coaching
- Observe for cultural responsiveness
- Coach toward warm demander stance
- Support information processing strategies
- Build classroom community

### For Curriculum
- Audit for cultural representation (deep, not surface)
- Examine assumptions about prior knowledge
- Build in collaborative structures
- Create relevance through connections

### For Classroom Visits
- Look for relationship evidence
- Notice cognitive access for all students
- Observe processing opportunities
- Check for collectivist structures

## Key Quotes

> "Culturally responsive teaching is about building students' brain power by creating cognitive structures for thinking and learning."

> "The goal isn't to entertain students but to challenge them academically."

> "Culture is the way that the brain makes sense of the world."

> "A warm demander creates conditions where students feel both cared for and challenged."
