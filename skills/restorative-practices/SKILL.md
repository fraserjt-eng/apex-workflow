# RESTORATIVE PRACTICES

## Core Philosophy

Restorative practices shift the focus from "what rule was broken" to "what harm was done and how can it be repaired." It prioritizes relationships, community, and accountability over punishment.

### Traditional vs. Restorative

| Traditional | Restorative |
|-------------|-------------|
| Rules broken | Harm done |
| Blame and punish | Repair and restore |
| School is victim | People are harmed |
| Offender is problem | Behavior is problem |
| What rule? What punishment? | What happened? Who was harmed? What needs to happen? |

## Restorative Continuum

## Restorative in the Classroom

### Prevention Through Community
- Regular circles (weekly minimum)
- Clear, co-created agreements
- Relationship-building routines
- Affective statements modeled

### Response to Minor Issues
- Affective questions first
- Private conversation when possible
- Focus on repair, not punishment
- Follow up to ensure resolution

### Documentation
- Focus on what happened, harm, and repair
- Note who was involved in resolution
- Track patterns (for systemic intervention)
- Celebrate successful repairs

## Reintegration

**Key Principle:** After harm is addressed, the person must be welcomed back into community.

**Reintegration elements:**
- Acknowledgment of repair work done
- Welcome from community members
- Relationship rebuilding opportunities
- No ongoing stigma or punishment
- Support for ongoing success

**Reintegration rituals:**
- Welcome back circle
- Acknowledgment of growth
- Peer buddy support
- Regular check-ins

## Implementation Challenges

### Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It takes too long" | Prevention saves time; relationships are investment |
| "Some behaviors need consequences" | RP includes accountability; repair IS consequence |
| "Victims won't participate" | Always voluntary; support alternatives |
| "Families want traditional discipline" | Explain approach; show outcomes |
| "Staff aren't trained" | Ongoing professional development |
| "Serious offenses can't be restorative" | RP works at all levels; may include other measures |

### Implementation Stages

**Stage 1: Awareness**
- Staff understand RP philosophy
- Some informal practices begin
- Champions identified

**Stage 2: Building Capacity**
- Systematic training begins
- Circles regular in some classrooms
- Responsive practices piloted

**Stage 3: Embedding**
- RP is "how we do things"
- All staff use RP language
- Formal conferences routine
- Data shows impact

**Stage 4: Sustaining**
- RP integrated in all systems
- Student leadership in RP
- Community involvement
- Continuous improvement

## Equity in Restorative Practices

**RP and Racial Justice:**
- RP emerged from indigenous practices
- Can address discipline disproportionality
- Must be implemented with cultural responsiveness
- Not just for students who cause harm

**Equity considerations:**
- Who gets RP vs. traditional discipline?
- Are circles culturally responsive?
- Is implementation consistent across groups?
- Does RP address power dynamics?

**Equity-centered RP:**
- Examine who benefits from RP
- Address implicit bias in implementation
- Include community cultural practices
- Monitor outcomes by group
