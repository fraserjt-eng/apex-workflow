# STREET DATA

**Source:** Shane Safir & Jamila Dugan - *Street Data: A Next-Generation Model for Equity, Pedagogy, and School Transformation* (2021)

## Core Concept

Street data is the qualitative, experiential, and community-generated data that reveals the human experience of school. It's the data that standardized tests and metrics cannot capture.

```
SATELLITE DATA                STREET DATA
───────────────              ───────────────
High altitude                 Ground level
Quantitative                  Qualitative
What happened                 Why it happened
Institutional view            Human experience
Aggregated                    Individual stories
Test scores, rates            Experiences, feelings
```

## The Street Data Principle

**Both types of data are essential. Neither is sufficient alone.**

- Satellite data tells us WHAT is happening
- Street data tells us WHY and HOW it feels

**Key Practice:** Never present satellite data without street data context.

## Three Levels of Data

### Level 1: Satellite Data
**What it is:** Large-scale quantitative data from above
- Standardized test scores
- Attendance rates
- Discipline data
- Graduation rates
- Survey percentages

**Strengths:**
- Shows patterns at scale
- Enables comparison
- Required for accountability

**Limitations:**
- Removes context
- Masks individual experience
- Doesn't explain causation
- Can reinforce deficit thinking

### Level 2: Map Data
**What it is:** Mid-level data that shows terrain
- Classroom observations
- Common formative assessments
- Student work analysis
- Walk-through data
- Disaggregated metrics

**Strengths:**
- Closer to classroom experience
- More actionable
- Shows variation

**Limitations:**
- Still institutional lens
- May miss student experience
- Often compliance-focused

### Level 3: Street Data
**What it is:** Ground-level, qualitative, experiential data
- Student shadow experiences
- Listening campaigns
- Focus groups
- Empathy interviews
- Story circles
- Student voice panels

**Strengths:**
- Reveals lived experience
- Surfaces root causes
- Centers marginalized voices
- Generates empathy and urgency

**Limitations:**
- Time-intensive
- Not easily quantified
- Requires relational trust
- May be dismissed as "anecdotal"

## Street Data Collection Methods

### 1. Shadow a Student

**Process:**
1. Select student (ideally from marginalized group)
2. Follow their entire day
3. See school through their eyes
4. Notice transitions, interactions, engagement
5. Debrief with reflection protocol

**Reflection Questions:**
- What was the student's experience of learning today?
- How many authentic interactions with adults?
- When was the student most engaged? Least?
- What barriers did they encounter?
- What would I change if this were my child?

### 2. Listening Campaigns

**Process:**
1. Identify listening question
2. Train listeners (not evaluators)
3. Conduct brief (5-7 min) listening sessions
4. Capture themes without judgment
5. Synthesize across interviews

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you felt seen at this school."
- "What helps you learn? What gets in the way?"
- "What do you wish teachers understood about you?"

### 3. Focus Groups

**Process:**
1. Convene small group (6-10) with shared experience
2. Use protocol to structure conversation
3. Create brave space for honesty
4. Center those most impacted
5. Capture themes and illustrative quotes

**Protocols:**
- Story circles (everyone shares, then themes)
- Focused discussion (questions with rounds)
- World café (rotating small groups)

### 4. Empathy Interviews

**Process:**
1. One-on-one extended conversation (30+ min)
2. Follow the person's lead
3. Ask "why" and "tell me more"
4. Listen for emotions and values
5. Look for patterns across interviews

**Stance:**
- Curious, not evaluative
- Listening to understand, not respond
- Following, not leading
- Holding space for complexity

### 5. Equity-Centered Walkthrough

**Different from compliance walkthrough:**
- What is the student experience, not teacher performance?
- Who is engaged? Who is not?
- Whose voices are represented in content?
- What messages does the environment send?
- Who is visible? Who is invisible?

## Integrating Street Data with Satellite Data

### The Integration Protocol

When presenting data:

```
1. START with street data (humanize first)
   "When we shadowed students, we noticed..."
   "In focus groups, students told us..."

2. LAYER in satellite data (contextualize)
   "This helps us understand why we're seeing..."
   "The numbers confirm what students are experiencing..."

3. RETURN to street data (call to action)
   "This means for students like Maria..."
   "When we think about what families shared..."
```

### Sample Integration

**DON'T:**
"Our suspension rate for Black males is 3x higher than white males."

**DO:**
"When we talked with Black male students, they described feeling targeted, over-monitored, and not given second chances. They shared specific stories of being removed from class for things they saw white peers do without consequence. When we look at our discipline data, we see this reflected in a 3x disparity in suspension rates. These aren't just numbers—they're the statistical shadow of real experiences of injustice."

## Street Data Principles

### 1. Prioritize the Margins
- Seek out the experiences of those most marginalized
- Those closest to the problem are closest to the solution
- If it works for the margins, it works for everyone

### 2. Listen to Understand, Not Evaluate
- Suspend judgment during collection
- Don't defend or explain
- Seek to learn, not validate assumptions

### 3. Weight Street Data Equally
- It's not supplementary to "real" data
- It IS data—just a different kind
- Both are necessary for full picture

### 4. Return Findings to Community
- Share what you heard back with community
- Validate interpretations
- Co-create solutions

### 5. Act on What You Hear
- Don't just collect—respond
- Street data without action erodes trust
- Even small responses matter

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Tokenistic listening | Regular, ongoing practice |
| Only hearing what confirms | Active seek disconfirming voices |
| Not returning findings | Close the loop with community |
| Collecting without acting | Commit to response before collecting |
| Dismissing as "anecdotal" | Name the bias toward quantitative |

## Application in BCCS Context

### For Equity Audits
- Shadow students from each demographic group
- Conduct family listening campaigns
- Interview students who left/were pushed out
- Include community voice in findings

### For PD Design
- What do teachers actually experience?
- Where are the real barriers?
- What do they wish leadership understood?

### For Initiative Evaluation
- Beyond "did we do it," how was it experienced?
- Who benefited? Who didn't?
- What unintended consequences?

### For Board Presentations
- Lead with street data (stories)
- Contextualize with satellite data
- Return to street data for implications

## Key Quotes

> "Street data is the qualitative evidence that provides rich, contextualized understanding of learning environments."

> "Satellite data can tell us what is happening; street data tells us why."

> "Those closest to the problem are closest to the solution."

> "Equity-centered transformation requires us to fundamentally change whose voices we center."
